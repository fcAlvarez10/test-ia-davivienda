    "In the world of workforce, procrastination and messy workflow is a common phenomenon, particularly with college students or non-administration level personnel in workplace. This is often due to the lack of clarity in objectives with the tasks given to them. Suppose a SWE in a startup was given a task to build a sign-in page for a web app. Things get messy and discouraging when the SWE was trying to start coding and asked questions like, \"should I build an auth server first or should I create the front end first?\". Those questions can branch off to smaller sub-questions, leaving the task puzzling and therefore driving procrastination. This phenomenon is highly replicable across different industries as well.\n",

      "- Identify manufacturing partners and production processes that adhere to sustainable practices.\n",
      "- Develop a marketing strategy highlighting the energy-efficient and smart features of the smoke detector.\n",
      "- Set a timeline for launch and distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How It Considers the Work Style:** This structured approach to planning emphasizes practicality and efficiency, ensuring that all aspects of the productâ€™s lifecycle are considered and managed in an organized manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Monitor and Iterate Post-Launch\n",
      "**Why Itâ€™s Needed:** Continuous monitoring post-launch helps in identifying any performance issues and user feedback for future improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What to Do:**\n",
      "- Collect data on device performance and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "- Address any issues promptly and plan for future iterations of the product based on user input.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How It Considers the Work Style:** This proactive approach to monitoring reflects your preference for mitigating risks early, ensuring long-term success and user satisfaction.\n",
